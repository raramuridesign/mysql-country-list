# SVG Flags

These flags have been added from Flagpack.

A note from FlagPack about these flags, and the ALPHA 2 CODES

### Flag Policy

Which flags should be included is an ongoing point of discussion within a project such as Flagpack. To provide some form of consistency, as of the 2.0 release Flagpack will be using the ISO 3166 standard as our baseline for our flag selection. In other words: Flagpack will provide flags for all ISO 3166 countries.

### Exceptions

As ISO 3166 specifies countries, we ran into two exceptions to our rule. Luckily 3166 has different subsets to provide us with alpha-2 codes for these specific exceptions.

### BES Islands

The Islands of Saba, Saint Eustasius and Bonaire are their own entity within the ISO standard, but don't have a shared flag. We chose to include them individually under the alpha-2 codes BQ-SA, BQ-BO and BQ-SE respectively. These codes are specified in ISO 3166-2:BQ.

### Countries within The United Kingdom
To provide some clear distinction within the different countries within The United Kingdom, we've opted to included the flags of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in Flagpack, along side the flag of the UK itself (alpha-2: GB-UKM). They use the alpha-2 codes of GB-ENG, GB-SCT, GB-WLS and GB-NIR respectively. These can be found in the ISO 3166-2:GB.
